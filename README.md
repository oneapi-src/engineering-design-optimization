## **Purpose**
In the past, products were mainly valued by customers for their utility. Gradually, aesthetics, novelty and slick designs have also become important factors among other factors that customers look for when purchasing products. Designers and engineers in the manufacturing industry often struggle with introducing novelty as it is a time-consuming process that includes iterating through multiple designs, comparing designs, ensuring that utility and quality of products are not compromised on account of design changes, etc. Depending on the product or tool being designed, it could take days, months or even years to come up with the right design for a product that meets the usefulness, novelty, and quality criteria for products.  

Customers have become extremely demanding over the years and expect new products to be introduced often. Companies also run the risk of losing market share to competitors if they are unable to keep up with customer demands.  

Generative design is the next frontier in CAD design for engineers working in virtually all manufacturing industries. It harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop new high-performance design iterations that help solve complex challenges, reduce component weights and manufacturing costs, scale customization, optimize performance and reduce product development cycle time.  

This reference kit demonstrates how Generative Adversarial Networks can be used to optimize and improve novelty in product design.

## **Reference Solution**
Conventional engineering design methods involve exploring designs and ideas interactively and even sometimes manually which add time and complexity to the design exploration. In fact, designers should spend vital time examining various design alternatives till they determine helpful solutions, so GAN data-driven methods such as the one described in this reference kit can enable designers to quickly synthesize new designs by reducing the complexity of design exploration.
This reference kit is a data-driven reference solution for design synthesis and proposes a method for guiding existing GAN models to synthesize novel designs. A state-of-the-art [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/lucidrains/stylegan2-pytorch) model is used to generate realistic designs. Other models (WideResNet, ResUNet) are then applied to automatically detect and locate the novel features in the generated designs, to then rewrite the original StyleGAN2 model using the detected most novel features through the concept of [rewriting GANs](https://rewriting.csail.mit.edu/).\
<br>Using a bicycle designs dataset to re-train the model, the StyleGAN2  model can create new bicycle designs with unique frames and handles, and generalize rare novelties to a broad set of designs, completely automatic and without requiring human intervention. As a post-processing step, a custom algorithm is applied on generated novel design images to suggest the most compact and novel designs.
### *Key Implementation Details*
The method implemented in this reference kit leverages multiple models and machine learning algorithms to detect the novel features and applies these features to rewrite the original GAN model. Details of the components implemented are as follows:
1. StyleGAN2 model architecture to synthesize design images
2. Novelty Detection and localization\
   a. WideResNet model architecture to extract features from the GAN generated images and training dataset\
   b. Find the top novel features and localize them in the image\
   c. ResUNet based segmentation model architecture to predict the part of the bike for a new novel design image
3. Rewrite the original StyleGAN2 model using detected most novel features.

As Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) models are often slow to generate images, the overall process of generating the novel and optimized design is relatively slow. This reference kit also demonstrates how Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit can help in minimize the time taken by GAN and other deep learning models used in generating the most optimized and novel design and in accelerating the overall process. This will help productionize the suggested method to generate the novel designs on scale.

Three benchmarkings are performed in this reference kit and are as follows:
1. Feature Extraction Inference time - Stock vs Intel® Extension for PyTorch
2. Segmentation Inference time- Stock vs Intel® Extension for PyTorch vs Intel® Neural Compressor
3. E2E pipeline Inference time - Stock vs Intel® Extension for PyTorch vs Intel® Neural Compressor

> Note: Additional info/inputs required from Intel on Quantization of models (Currently quantization done for models in E2E pipeline)

## **Reference Implementation**
The reference implementation of different deep learning models in this reference kit is based on PyTorch v1.13.0.
<br>The StyleGAN2 model used in this implementation to generate bike design images is pre-trained on the Biked Dataset . Then, the novelty feature detection and localization method, which relies on features extracted from generated images using a pre-trained Wide Residual Newtorks50 (WideResNet50) architecture and a pre-trained ResUNet based segmentation model architecture used to segment the different parts of the bike in the generated bike design images. Finally, the segmented feature mask is used to modify the StyleGAN2 model using the model rewriting approach so that it generates the most novel and optimized bike designs.

## Appendix
### **Running on Windows**
The reference kits commands are linux based, in order to run this on Windows, goto Start and open WSL and follow the same steps as running on a linux machine starting from git clone instructions. If WSL is not installed you can [install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
> **Note** If WSL is installed and not opening, goto Start ---> Turn Windows feature on or off and make sure Windows Subsystem for Linux is checked. Restart the system after enabling it for the changes to reflect.

### Known Issues

1. Common prerequisites required to run python scripts in linux system.
    Install gcc and curl.  For Ubuntu, this will be: 

      ```bash
      apt-get update
      apt-get install gcc
      apt-get install git
      ```

2. ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
   
    **Issue:**
      ```
      ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
      or
      libgthread-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
      ```

    **Solution:**

      Install the libgl1 and libglib2.0-0 libraries. For Ubuntu this will be:

      ```bash
     sudo apt install libgl1
     sudo apt install libglib2.0-0
      ```
3. Optimization instructions for StyleGAN2 and quantization instructions for StyleGAN2 and WideResNet, as well as performance benchmarks, to come.
